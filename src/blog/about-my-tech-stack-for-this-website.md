## Introduction

This is my personal Blog and my playground. I built this website from scratch and on my own. I just want to write some blog posts about my journey in powerlifting, learning korean and web development.

## My Role

I was the designer and the developer. And I am also the owner and admin of this page ðŸ˜Š.



## Problem

I had no page where I can write about my thoughts. I also want to own my data and don't want to use a database for that. So I created this "small" website. All blogpost are saved as markdown files. So I can transfer them easily to other blog platforms if needed. 

Also I want to experiment with this page. This page is not commercial. I don't care about SEO or performance. The latter may be a lie ðŸ¥¸...
But I always want to stay accessible. 
On this page I can do whatever I want. Use heavy animations or using fancy javascript stuff. 

## My Solution

To build this page I used the static site generator Eleventy. Eleventy produces with markdown plain html pages. In the first version this page doesn't have javascript.
For styling I use scss, but can also be accomplished with plain css.
As a Content Management System I use netlifyCMS. It is open source and free. With this CMS I can easily create markdown or json files without touching the source code. Everything is git-based.
The implementation was easy so far. I like it. 

## Future goals
  
For the future I plan to add some features like search and comments. Maybe.
My go-to framework would be alpine js.
Alpine js is lightweight and more better suited for me than plain javascript.
